Conduct the performance measurements: you will find the running times in the test report.
Create a new doc folder in the project.
Create a document called README.txt in doc and answer the various TODO Questions embedded in the code.


TestIterator:
  // TODO Question: Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

 // TODO Question: What happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))? 
  the first 77 encountered is removed


TestList:

TODO Question: Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

TODO Question: What does this method do? Gets rid of element @ index of 5

TODO Question: What does this one do? Removes the first submission of the value 5


TestPerformance:

TODO Question: What conclusions can you draw about the performance of LinkedList vs. ArrayList when
comparing their running times for AddRemove vs. Access? Record those running times in README.txt!



Test method runtimes:
2s, 1s, 2s, 1s
